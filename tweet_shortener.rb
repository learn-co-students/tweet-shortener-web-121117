# 1. Write a method, `word_substituter` that takes in a string of a tweet as an argument and shortens that string
# based on the allowed substitutes. Use your `dictionary` method that contains your dictionary hash to compare
# the words in the tweet against the keys in the hash. If there are any matches, replace the word in the tweet with
#  the associated substitute from the hash.
#     * **Hint:** How can you iterate over every word in a tweet and compare it to the hash keys? Convert the
#     tweet into an array to enable this. Then, make sure to convert it back into a string to return the
#     shortened tweet at the end of the method.
#     * **Hint:** How can you grab all of the keys of the hash for the purpose of comparing them to the words
#     in the tweet? Use the `.keys` method.

# Write a method, `bulk_tweet_shortener` that takes in an array of tweets, iterates over them,
# shortens them, and `puts` out the results to the screen.
#   * **Hint:** You already wrote a method that shortens tweets. Use it!
#   * **Hint:** Remember that you can `puts` out the result of a method by putting `puts` in front of the method call.
